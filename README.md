# SortStepJS
A JS web app that visualizes sorting algorithms, by sorting an array in real-time. It also plays sound as it's sorting, 
according to the item it's currently on.

## Why SortStepJS?
SortStep is a genre of music created by the auditory result of sorting algorithms. 
It's pretty sweeeeeeeeet to hear.

## Developments Coming Soon
- More sorting algorithms coming soon!
- Gonna improve the dark theme.
- More sound effects or sound themes coming soon.

## Bugs
- One of the elements, primarily the first one, isn't getting sorted, and remains at the beginning. 
I'm aware of this, and trying to sort out the bug, but it's proving taxing for now. Will keep trying to fix it though.
